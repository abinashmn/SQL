PetMind is a retailer of products for pets. They are based in the United States.

PetMind sells products that are a mix of luxury items and everyday items. Luxury items include toys. Everyday items include food.

The company wants to increase sales by selling more products for some animals repeatedly. 

They have been testing this approach for the last year. 

They now want a report on how repeat purchases impact sales.

# Task 1

From taking a quick look at the data, you are pretty certain it isn't quite as it should be. You need to make sure all of the data is clean before you start your analysis. The table below shows what the data should look like. 

Write a query to return a table that matches the description provided.

Do not update the original table.

# Task 2

You want to show whether sales are higher for repeat purchases for different animals. You also want to give a range for the sales.

Write a query to return the `animal`, `repeat_purchase` indicator and the `avg_sales`, along with the `min_sales` and `max_sales`. All values should be rounded to whole numbers. 

You should use the original `pet_supplies` data for this task. 



# Task 3

The management team want to focus on efforts in the next year on the most popular pets - cats and dogs - for products that are bought repeatedly. 

Write a query to return the `product_id`, `sales` and `rating` for the relevant products.

You should use the original `pet_supplies` data for this task.
