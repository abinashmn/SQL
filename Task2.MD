# Task 2

You want to show whether sales are higher for repeat purchases for different animals. You also want to give a range for the sales.

Write a query to return the `animal`, `repeat_purchase` indicator and the `avg_sales`, along with the `min_sales` and `max_sales`. All values should be rounded to whole numbers. 

You should use the original `pet_supplies` data for this task.
